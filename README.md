Custom Dropdown Angular 2 custom dropdown with scroll , search and key events

In our development we might have struggled with handling dropdowns , I have created custom dropdown reusable component with scroll and handled search and key events â€“ it will save our time in development. Attached are some images how it looks like.

Please refer the GitHub link below. I have uploaded full component. Also you can go through with the demo as well.

Benefits:

1. Cross Browser compatibility of dropdowns.
2. Reusable and can be used as Form Element itself.
3. Validation Logic are handled in component.
4. Can be used in Reactive or Template driven both Forms.
